## Modules

### Pre-processing

Handles the initial stages of the reconciliation process:

- **File Upload**: Accepts and processes file uploads, ensuring they are in the correct format and free from common errors.
- **File Metadata Determination**: Extracts and determines metadata from uploaded files.
- **Unique File ID Generation**: Every file is assigned a unique ID based on its content to avoid duplication and ensure traceability.
- **File Storage**: Files are saved to a designated storage location, with future support for cloud storage solutions like Amazon S3.

### Reconciliation Engine

This is the core of the platform where the actual reconciliation takes place:

- **Data Comparison**: Compares data between primary and comparison files.
- **Rule Application**: Applies user-defined rules to handle discrepancies.
- **Result Generation**: Produces a detailed report of the reconciliation, highlighting matches, mismatches, and any issues encountered.

### Reporting

Generates detailed reports post-reconciliation:

- **Visual Reports**: Graphical representation of reconciliation results.
- **Detailed Logs**: In-depth logs detailing every step of the reconciliation process.
- **Export Options**: Allows users to export reports in various formats like PDF, CSV, etc.

### Notification

Keeps users informed:

- **Email Alerts**: Sends email notifications about the status of reconciliation tasks.
- **Dashboard Notifications**: Real-time notifications on the platform's dashboard.
